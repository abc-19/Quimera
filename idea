	Quimera - whole idea

	The idea is to implement a spreadsheet engine which will allow me to
	learn several things about software develpment, this is a really hard
	projects based on all the things it envolves...

	It has to have a visual and real-time representation of the data just
	like libreOffice-calc or Excel, for sure it is not meant to be a rival
	for those SpreadSheet engines but i am really interested in this project.

	I've already tried to implement this one year ago but it was impossible
	to me, maybe this time it won't be, i do not really know how to start
	but i gotta start somewhere.

	The first thing i'd like to do is to parse the arguments given to the
	program by using <getopt.h> since it makes it easier to do. I do not
	know how to store all the information the program will work with...

	I just reached the idea that the sheet is not the same as the document,
	therefore a document can have multiple sheets on it, which is gonna
	make this thing even harder.

	Once i parsed the arguments using getopt, the next step would be to
	draw the tui... I found a way to displat the row numbers faster!
	we cannot allow ourselves to print every single row number by its
	own printf call, instead since there's a fixed number of rows, we're
	gonna hardcode all row numbers into an array and then display just
	the needed number of rows by a single printf call.
